# Weather App 

This is a simple weather application built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** that allows users to search for a city and view real-time weather information. The app fetches live data from the **OpenWeatherMap API** and displays current temperature, humidity, wind speed, and a weather icon based on conditions.

## Features

- Search weather by city name
- Displays:
  - Current temperature (°C)
  - Humidity percentage
  - Wind speed (km/h)
- Dynamic weather icons (Clear, Clouds, Rain, Drizzle, Mist)

- Clean, responsive card-style UI

## How It Works

1. The user enters a city name into the search bar.
2. When the search button is clicked, the app sends a request to the OpenWeatherMap API.
3. The API returns current weather data for the city.
4. The app updates the UI dynamically using JavaScript.
5. If the city name is invalid, an error message is displayed instead.
